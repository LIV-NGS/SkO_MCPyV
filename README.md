# Merkel cell polyomavirus infection and persistence modelled in skin organoids

**Abstract**
```
Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) causes most Merkel cell carcinomas (MCC). The virus is one of the few known human tumor viruses, and due to its direct
role in this skin cancer development, it is a bona fide model for viral tumorigenesis and tumorigenesis in general. Chronic viruses in humans such as
MCPyV are highly adapted to their host and current models to study infection, persistence and pathogenesis are highly limited. We here use an induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hair-bearing skin organoid (SkO) system to demonstrate efficient viral infection, progression and spread of MCPyV.
Using bulk-, single cell - and spatial-transcriptomics, combined with immunostaining and nucleic acid hybridization technologies, we show that MCPyV
ensures persistence due to a quasi-latency state within the majority of dermal fibroblasts carry the viral genome. Further, we identify the cell type of
productive infection with papillary fibroblasts and dermal sheath fibroblasts supporting viral replication and progeny production. Our high-resolution
methods demonstrate that the virus in these cells evades the innate immune response, as evidenced by the efficacy of interferon-beta treatment or
ruxolitinib, a JAK/STAT inhibitor, in suppressing or stimulating viral replication. We show that iPSC-derived SkOs are able to support infection and long-
term persistence of the virus under conditions very similar to those found in humans. Thus, this infection model provides a robust platform for
understanding and characterizing the interaction of this virus with the immune system in infection, testing treatment strategies to control reactivation
and map processes involved in tumor development.
